# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello! I'm Noor, a Computer Science student with a concentration in Cyber and Network Security. I am passionate about software development, particularly in the areas of networking and cybersecurity. Below are some of the projects I've been working on:

## Projects

### ML Threat Detector
**Technologies:** Python, Flask, Next.js, Scikit-Learn, Kafka, PostgreSQL (Supabase), Linux  
**Features:**  
- Built as a team project using an unsupervised machine learning model to detect anomalous user activity on Linux systems in real time.  
- Implemented secure user authentication with Google SSO and JWT session handling for seamless access control.  
- Designed backend data models and REST API endpoints in Flask to manage users and virtual machines stored in Supabase.  
- Developed a Kafka consumer service to process ML output streams and deliver instant security alerts when suspicious behavior is detected.

### Network Automation Dashboard
**Technologies:** Python (FastAPI, Paramiko), React, Tailwind CSS, SSH Automation  
**Features:**  
- Full-stack dashboard for monitoring system health, service status, and WireGuard VPN metrics on my Linux server.  
- FastAPI backend retrieves real-time CPU, memory, disk, and service data through secure SSH automation.  
- Responsive React frontend displays system metrics using interactive cards and detailed log views.  
- Includes automated configuration backups and drift-detection for critical network and system files.

### Minecraft Mod
**Technologies:** Java, Minecraft Forge, JSON, Git  
**Features:**  
- Custom in-game items, including swords, armor, and clothing.  
- Utilized object-oriented programming for item properties.  
- Managed assets with JSON files for seamless integration.

### Packet Sniffer
**Technologies:** Python, Scapy, Colorama  
**Features:**  
- Real-time packet sniffing on a specified network interface using Scapy.
- Captures HTTP requests and extracts potential usernames and passwords from unencrypted traffic.
- Provides insight into network security vulnerabilities by monitoring raw packet data.
- Easy to use with command-line arguments for interface selection.

### Live Chat Room
**Technologies:** Java, JavaScript, Spring Boot  
**Features:**  
- Real-time chat application using WebSockets.
- Bi-directional communication between client and server.
- Robust connection management with event listeners.
